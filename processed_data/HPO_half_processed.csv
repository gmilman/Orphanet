A fibrous tissue increase is not a feature, and complications such as defects of the lesion surface and thrombosis are not present. The type IV lesion is also known as atheroma. Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type. Thus, atheroma is, at least initially, an eccentric lesion.",,HP:0002635

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation.

Hypophosphatemic rickets is the most common type of rickets that is characterized by low levels of serum phosphate, resistance to ultraviolet radiation or vitamin D intake. There are several issues involved in hypophosphatemic rickets such as calcium, vitamin D, phosphorus deficiencies. Moreover, other disorder can be associated with its occurrence such as absorption defects due to pancreatic, intestinal, gastric, and renal disorders and hepatobiliary disease. Symptoms are usually seen in childhood and can be varied in severity. Severe forms may be linked to bowing of the legs, poor bone growth, and short stature as well as joint and bone pain.

The nostril is cleft through the alar dome and extends above onto the nasal dorsum. It passes medial to a normal, but dys- topic, medial canthus. There is an alveolar cleft between the central and lateral incisors that extends above through the pyriform margin lateral to the anterior nasal spine; the nasal septum is not involved. The bony cleft extends through the nasal bone or between the junction of the nasal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. Above the cleft lip, the clefting of the alar dome is associated with deviation to the opposite side of the shortened and broadened columella and nasal tip. Extension of the soft tissue cleft onto the nasal dorsum can be manifest as a series of vertical soft tissue furrows and ridges. Vertical inner canthal dysto- pia and severe telecanthus mark the superior aspect of the Number 1 facial cleft. A cranial soft tissue extension characterized by a tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline delineates the number 13 cleft. Skeletal clefting of the maxilla may extend posteriorly to form a complete cleft of the hard and soft palate. The maxilla is hypoplastic in all three dimensions. There is a keel-shaped alveolus and anterior open bite. Normal septation is preserved between the nasal cavity and the hypoplastic maxillary antrum on the affected side. Distortion of the nasal skeleton produces gross flattening of the nasal dorsum.

There is normal septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus. Notching at the junction between the nasal bone is present, as is a broad, flat frontal process of the maxilla. Transverse ethmoid enlargement produces orbital hypertelorism. Above the cleft of the lip and palate is a true broad cleft of the nostril that is medial to the intact, but laterally displaced, tail of the alar cartilage. A shallow soft tissue groove extends superiorly to the asymmetrically widened nasal root. The lacrimal system, palpebral fissures, and eyebrows remain intact.

The cleft continues superiorly to involve the inner canthus and lower eyelid medial to the inferior lacrimal punctum, thereby disrupting the nasolacrimal system. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft is between the lateral incisor and the canine. Absent septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary antrum, together with the distortion of the frontal process of the maxilla and lacrimal fossa, produces direct communication between the orbit, maxillary sinus, and nose. There is hypoplasia of the soft tissue margins of the cleft in the vertical dimension. This produces extreme soft tissue deficiency between the alar base and the cleft of the medial aspect of the lower eyelid. The inferior lacrimal punctum is evident at the lateral margin of the lower eyelid cleft. The lacrimal drainage system ends as an opening directly onto the cheek without communication into the nasal cavity. The globe is normal in size, but it is displaced inferiorly and laterally. The nasal septum shows the characteristic distortion seen in typical cleft lip and palate. There is absence of septation between the nasal cavity on the cleft side and the maxilla. The maxilla is hypoplastic in three dimensions, with a marked reduction in pneumatization. Superior extension of the skeletal clefting into the medial portion of the orbital floor and into the inferior orbital rim in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla allows direct communication between the orbit above and the nasomaxillary region below. There is mild narrowing of the ethmoid sinus and of the body of the sphenoid on the cleft side.

The lacrimal system and inner canthus are normal. Microphthalmia may be present. The alveolar cleft passes between the lateral incisor and canine, as in the Number 3 cleft. The cleft passes around the pyriform aperture and continues through the portion of the maxillary sinus medial to the infraorbital foramen. The cleft terminates at the medial end of the inferior orbital rim. There is severe vertical soft tissue deficiency in a Number 4 cleft, with the medial margins of the cleft lip extending directly into the medially placed cleft of the lower eyelid. Within the medial segment of the right-sided cleft lip, muscle elements are apparently absent. Muscle bunching is noted in the ipsilateral lateral lip segment, as is seen in a typical unilateral cleft lip. The anatomically normal nasal ala is superiorly displaced in association with a severe deficiency in the overall nasal length. Marked dystopia of the right globe results in its inferior displacement into the medially deficient orbital floor and inferior rim. Both globes are otherwise normal. The complete palatal cleft passes through the maxilla medial to the infraorbital foramen and extends to the medial portion of the inferior orbital rim without evidence of an intact maxillary sinus. Bony septation persists medially, thereby separating the nasal cavity from the orbit, maxillary sinus, and mouth, which are contiguous. Marked midfacial hypoplasia is present. The cleft is manifest as asymmetry of the body of the sphenoid; it is smaller on the right, with asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline.

There is a vertical soft tissue deficiency between the lateral portion of the lip and the lower eyelid cleft. The left side of the nose shows vertical shortening, and the left alar base is displaced superiorly. Facial asymmetry secondary to the skeletal abnormality is reflected by a vertical orbital dystopia. However, bothglobes are normal, and there is no abnormality of the upper eyelids, eyebrow, forehead, or frontal hairline. The skeletal clefts vary, ranging from a narrow skeletal furrow that traverses the anterior maxillary wall as on the rightto a broad cleft of the maxilla lateral to the infraorbital foramen and maxillary sinus. This latter cleft enters the inferolateral orbital rim and floor without posterior communication with the inferior orbital fissure on the left side. Medial collapse of the lateral maxillary segments is present bilaterally, with reduction in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary arch. Manifestations of the skeletal disturbance in the sphenoid include a shortening and thickening of the lateral orbital walls in the region of the greater wing and mild asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline.

Microphthalmia is not observed. The skeletal cleft is between the maxilla and zygoma; it passes through the inferolateral orbital rim to enter the inferior orbital fissure. No alveolar cleft is present. The zygomatic arch is intact. The soft tissue furrow, which is more apparent on the right, radiates from the oral commissure toward the lateral two-thirds of the lower eyelid. The antimongoloid obliquity of the palpebral fissures is associated with laterally placed lower eyelid clefts and some ectropion. A left-sided anophthalmia is accompanied by adjacent soft tissue hypoplasia and is reflected in a short palpebral fissure, enophthalmos, and minor ptosis of the eyebrow. No abnormality is present in the alveolar arch except for some tilting of the occlusal plane secondary to hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla. There is a vertical bony groove in the region of the zygomaticomaxillary suture that ends in the inferolateral portion of a small bony orbit. More laterally, the remainder of the zygomatic body and arch is normal in both shape and dimension. The lateral orbital floor is downslanting but intact, and it lacks direct communication with the temporal or infratemporal fossae.

The maxilla is hypoplastic, although the maxillary sinuses are symmetrically pneumatized. The hypoplastic zygomatic body arches upward, but then it takes a downward course and is severely malformed and displaced. The zygoma is continuous posteriorly with an apparently normal zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The mandibular condyle and coronoid process are hypoplastic and asymmetric.

Skeletal defects are more prominent in Treacher Collins syndrome, whereas the soft tissue clefting is more typical in cases of ''Goldenhar syndrome''. Soft tissue clefting presents as a dermatocele, a true lateral eyelid coloboma with absence of the outer canthus, and anomalies of the globe itself, especially epibulbar cysts in patients with Goldenhar syndrome. The frontozygomatic bony cleft produces absence of the lateral orbital rim; this border now is formed by the hypoplastic greater wing of the sphenoid. The absence of bony support for the outer canthus produces lateral canthal dystopia and the characteristic antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures. Secondary to the bony deficiency in the lateral orbital wall and floor, there is soft tissue continuity between the orbit, temporal fossa, and infratemporal region. Preauricular hairline indicators delineate the Number 8 cleft as the first of the northbound clefts. Complete absence of the bony lateral orbital wall and rim constitute the skeletal element of the Number 8 cleft. The lateral border of the orbit is formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid from which small spicules of bone, which represent the rudimentary zygoma, may be found in Treacher Collins syndrome.

The symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis can be explained by an increase in lumbar lordosis and spinal canal stenosis in an upright position compared to the sitting position or if spondylolisthesis is present by a shift of the vertebrae while standing and walking. Following an individually characteristic distance, walking becomes associated with deep muscular pain and with neurological deficits, such as sensory deficits and paresis in the lower limbs, which resolve within minutes when the affected person sits or lies down.

Accordingly, two distinct subtypes of VIN are recognised: the HPV-associated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/usual VIN (HSIL/uVIN) and the non-HPV-associated differentiated VIN (dVIN). HSIL is clinically identified by its multifocal, warty appearance and on histology by conspicuous cytological and architectural atypia. Differentiated VIN, on the other hand, often produces ill-defined lesions, and on histology, notoriously mimics non-neoplastic epithelial disorders (NNED), particularly LS.

Most patients with cortical myoclonus have both positive myoclonus and NM, occurring either independently or together as a complex of the two kinds of myoclonus. If cortical myoclonus is prolonged and lasts for hours, days or weeks, it is called epilepsia partials continua and is considered to be a rare form of focal epileptic status.

16808,Absent cavum septum pellucidum,4000138,The cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is an important fetal midline forebrain landmark that is normally visible by prenatal sonography. This term refers to the lack of visiblity of the CSP on prenatal sonography. The CSP normally can be visualized between 18 and 37 weeks of gestation. Lack of visualization of the CSP in this time period generally requires follow up and may indicate the presence of underlying malformations such as malformations of the corpus callosum. The lack of CSP before 18 weeks or after 37 weeks of gestation (or postnatally) is considered a normal finding.,,HP:4000138
16809,Fetal abdominal cyst,4000139,"Fetal abdominal cysts are usually detected during the second trimester anomaly scan or discovered incidentally at later gestations. However, a definitive diagnosis is often not made until postnatal life. The most common etiologies of fetal abdominal cysts are: ovarian, gastrointestinal cystic duplication, liver and choledochal, meconium pseudocysts, mesenteric and adrenal. Following identification of a cyst, careful morphological assessment allows the prediction of their natural history and importantly, the likelihood of surgical intervention being required postnatally.","Fetal cystic abdominal mass, Foetal abdominal cyst, Foetal cystic abdominal mass",HP:4000139
